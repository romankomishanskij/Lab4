"""
vector.py â€” A module for working with 2D vectors.

This module defines a `Vector` class that provides a simple and intuitive interface
for performing operations on two-dimensional vectors. It includes functionality for:

- Vector addition and subtraction
- Scalar multiplication and division
- Dot product calculation
- Magnitude (length) computation
- Vector normalization
- Angle calculation between two vectors

Operator overloading allows using standard Python syntax for vector arithmetic:
    - `+`, `-` for addition and subtraction
    - `*` for scalar multiplication and dot product
    - `/` for scalar division
    - `==` for vector equality
    - `abs()` to get vector magnitude
    - `-vector` to reverse vector direction

Raises:
    - `TypeError` when operands are of invalid type
    - `ZeroDivisionError` when dividing by zero
    - `NotImplementedError` for unsupported operations like exponentiation

Example usage:
    >>v1 = Vector(3, 4)
    >>v2 = Vector(1, 2)
    >> v1 + v2
    vector: (x = 4, y = 6)
    >> abs(v1)
    5.0
    >> v1.normalize()
    vector: (x = 0.6, y = 0.8)
